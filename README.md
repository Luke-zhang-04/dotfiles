`./npm-packages` and `./aur-packages` are just a list of packages

For AUR, you should be able to just `yay -S $(cat ./aur-packages)`

## Licensing
- `./bin/spotify-status` is MIT Licensed.
- Everything else is free game (0BSD)

## Linux Distro
These are meant for ArchLinux with i3 and X11. If you try on something like Manjaro I'm not sure if they'll work

## Libinput?
Libinput allows for swiping between workspaces. I sometimes find is useful.
