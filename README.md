## Details

`./npm-packages` and `./aur-packages` are just a list of packages

For npm, you should be able to just `npm i -g $(cat ./npm-packages)`

For AUR, you should be able to just `yay -S $(cat ./aur-packages)`

## Licensing
- `./bin/spotify-status` is MIT Licensed.
- Everything else is free game (0BSD)

## Linux Distro
These are meant for ArchLinux with i3 and X11. If you try on something like Manjaro I'm not sure if they'll work

Libinput allows for swiping between workspaces. I sometimes find is useful.
